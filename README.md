### This is not my personal project but about 80% of the code from this version is mine(indicated by comments). [this](https://github.com/JacobAButler/WeCanDoThisTooBot) is the original repo we've worked on. I created this repo because I'm too impatient to wait for it to be merged so I can show this to the rest my other friends.
# WCDTTBot
Bot for an experimental private subreddit that weekly:
Adds random users,
Kicks inactive users depending on their ranks,
posts a recap about it.
### We know this is done before, we just wanted to make one our own.
