dailyPostCheck                (not started)     -changed some function names because my IDE pressured me to. No offense.
getNewUsers                   (EViLeleven)      -objects in the user_list should have an integer instead of making it
generateFallenList            (needs work)          hold dates and activity as strings. So we can have a simpler ranking
generateRecapPost             (text formatting)     algorithm.
                                                -we should make main.py run once in a week and manually instead of
                                                    hosting it to sleep for 24 hours each day.
                                                -algorithms I've used for randomly finding new users and adjusting ranks
                                                    are open to change, see them in botUtils.py.
DONE:
readUserList                  (done)
addUsers                      (done)            -I don't see how these two work? I only see a print statement followed
removeFallen                  (done)                by comments. I am sorry If I've deleted something important just
updateUsers                   (done)                because I do not understand(which I ocassionally do), I just
                                                    couldn't work with what is done. You have the option to not to
                                                    merge, it wont upset me.
